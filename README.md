### Setup Project

   - You can choose between JavaScript and TypeScript templates during installation.
   - Run this if you are setting up the project for the first time.

2. **Uninstall Project:**
   - Uninstalls the project and optionally removes Node.js and npm.
   - Use this to clean up the project from your system.

3. **Uninstall Dependencies:**
   - Uninstalls only the project dependencies without deleting the project files.
   - Use this if you need to reset the dependencies.

4. **Eject Project:**
   - Ejects the project configuration, giving you full control over the build configuration.
   - Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back.

5. **Setup Existing Project:**

   - This option is currently a placeholder and may require manual stopping depending on your environment.

3. **Test Project:**
